# Whac A Mole Arduino Project 

This is my first Computer Systems Architecture coursework where I developed a 2 player Whack-A-Mole game using the Arduino.

Each player had a set of LEDs and a push button, and the objective was to "whack" the lit LED by pressing the button within a specific timeframe.

```
Achievements:

Two-Player Game: Created a two-player game, allowing for head-to-head competition.

Random LED Activation: LEDs lit up randomly, creating an unpredictable gameplay experience.

Scoring System: The game featured a scoring system where players earned points for hitting the button within the LED's active duration.

Visual Feedback: The use of red and green LEDs provided visual feedback to indicate success or failure.

Game Completion: The game ended when a player reached 10 points, with LED lights flickering to signify the conclusion.
